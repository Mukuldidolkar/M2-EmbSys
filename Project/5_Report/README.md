## Report:
The project was developed to understand the uses of ultrasonic sensor in distance measurement. The requirements for the project were collected and classified into two types mainly low level requirement and high level requirements. The components required for the project were also identified. The SWOT analysis of the project was also carried out and the 4W's and 1H analysis was also performed to know more insights about the project, after the requirement stage was complete the architecture of the project was looked upon , in architecture the circuit/block diagram of the project was drawn. this project is implemented using arduino uno the program for the arduino was written and compiled in arduino IDE. The circuit was simulated using simuleide, where the circuit was created using arduino uno, 16x2 Lcd screen, Ultrasonic sensor, potentiometer, power supply and then the code compiled in arduino IDE was dumped onto our circuit. Due to some limitations of simuleide we used potentiometer to simulate the distance between the object and the ultrasonic sensor. The results of simulation and the testing of high level and low level requirements was conducted and then verified.The main moto of this project was to understand the concepts of basic embedded system like sensors, actuators, processors etc and how an embedded system works.
